// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
Design
Maintain
Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
Planning

1. planning
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. implementation
5. testing and integration
6. Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysis = "this is the second step, clearly define the requirements and to get them approved "
const design = "defines all modules of the prodct along with its communication and data flow representation"
const implementation = "developmers must follow through the coding guidelines and build what is required"
const testingAndIntegration = "the code is complete and now it is being testing to make sure it does not break when consumers are using it"
const Maintain = "changes or bugs might happen in the code and it is the coders job to be able to fix it if anything breaks or implement new changes"
